# Pinch zoom for Angular

The module provides opportunities for image zooming in, zooming out and positioning with use of gestures on a touch screen.


## Installation

Install the npm package.

```
npm i @meddv/ngx-pinch-zoom
```

Import module:

```ts
import { PinchZoomComponent } from '@meddv/ngx-pinch-zoom';

@NgModule({
    imports: [ PinchZoomComponent ]
})
```

## Usage

For use, put your image inside the &lt;pinch-zoom&gt; container. Please, pay attention to the parameters of your viewport metatag. If you use Pinch Zoom, it is required to limit zooming of a web-page, by entering the following parameters: &lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"&gt;.

```html
<pinch-zoom>
    <img src="path_to_image" />
</pinch-zoom>
```

| listeners           | "auto", "mouse and touch"     | "mouse and touch"     | By default, subscriptions are made for mouse and touch screen events. The value `auto` means that the subscription will be only for touch events or only for mouse events, depending on the type of screen.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

| autoHeight          | boolean                       | false                 | Calculate the height of the container based on the `width` and `height` attributes of the image. By default, the width of the container is 100%, and the height is determined after the image information is loaded - this may cause a delay in determining the height of the container. If you want the container to initially have dimensions corresponding to the dimensions of the image, then specify the attributes `width` and `height` for the `<img>` tag. When setting the property value to `true`, a subscription to the window resize listener will be created. |
